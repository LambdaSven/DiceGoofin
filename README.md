## Dice Goofin

This is a small dice-rolling program I made to practice the skills I was learning in Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com). 

This almost certainly could be impelemented better (Using Java code as a basis for a TS implementation creates some awkward TS code), however it was useful to solidify my understanding of various concepts - particularly Recursive Descent Parsing.

I might write an article about this goof some day.
